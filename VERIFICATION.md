# Verification workflow

How a value gets from "we think we know this" to "rendered on the site."

This is the single source of truth for data integrity. It overrides
convenience, polish, SEO scale, or any pressure to populate more rows.

---

## Repository guard

The canonical unverified-data label (the literal string exported as
`UNVERIFIED_LABEL` from `apps/models/lib/verified.ts`) may only appear in:

- `apps/models/components/DataNotVerified.tsx` (the renderer)
- `apps/models/lib/verified.ts` (the constant declaration)
- `README.md`
- `VERIFICATION.md`
- Tests whose filename matches `DataNotVerified.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}` or
  `data-not-verified.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}`

Any other file — route pages, seed data, arbitrary components, llms.txt
copy — must render the label through the `<DataNotVerified>` component
or interpolate the `UNVERIFIED_LABEL` constant. Inline duplication is
forbidden because it bypasses the rendering policy and drifts over time.

The guard is enforced by:

```bash
npm run check:integrity
```

It is wired into `npm run validate` alongside lint, typecheck, and build,
so any unauthorized occurrence fails the local validation flow. The
script lives at [`scripts/check-data-not-verified-usage.ts`](scripts/check-data-not-verified-usage.ts).

## The core rule

**Every metric on this site has a citation, or it does not exist.**

A "metric" is anything a reader could act on or be misled by:
pricing, context window, max output, modality, release/snapshot dates,
knowledge cutoff, lifecycle (active/deprecated/retired), benchmark scores,
latency, uptime, regions, features.

The type system enforces this: metric fields are typed
`MaybeVerified<T> = VerifiedField<T> | null`. `VerifiedField<T>` requires
a `SourceCitation` at construction time. There is no escape hatch.

Unverified values render through `<VerifiedField>` and `<DataNotVerified>`,
which output the literal string `Data not yet verified.` Never write that
string by hand — use the components.

## What counts as a primary source

Allowed (`sourceType`):

| `sourceType` | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `official-vendor-docs` | The vendor's own product documentation under a `docs.*` or equivalent path. |
| `official-vendor-pricing` | The vendor's official pricing reference page. |
| `official-vendor-site` | The vendor's primary marketing/product site, used only when the docs site is unavailable or does not cover the field. |
| `regulatory-filing` | SEC/EU/etc. filing by the vendor. |
| `research-paper` | Peer-reviewed or arXiv-published paper by the vendor. |
| `public-dataset` | Verified third-party benchmark dataset releases (HF/HELM/Papers-with-Code style). |

Not allowed as primary sources for metric claims:

- Blog posts (even vendor blog posts — they're announcements, not specs).
- Twitter / X posts.
- Reddit, Hacker News, Discord.
- LinkedIn posts or press releases.
- Secondary summary sites, model directories, "leaderboard" sites.
- Wikipedia.
- AI-generated content.

If the only available reference is a blog post or announcement, the value
**stays null** until a docs/pricing page reflects it.

## Manual verification checklist

Use this when adding or refreshing a verified value. Every box must be
checkable before merging.

### Before editing

- [ ] The source page is on an allow-listed primary domain.
- [ ] The source page is accessible without authentication.
- [ ] The source page has not been changed since you last looked (open it now).

### When adding a citation

Add the citation to `apps/models/data/citations.ts` if it doesn't already
exist. Citations are registered once and referenced by import — never
inlined in entity files. Required fields:

- [ ] `url` is an absolute https URL.
- [ ] `name` is human-readable and uniquely identifies the source.
- [ ] `type` is one of the allow-listed `SourceType` values.
- [ ] `retrievedAt` is set to the ISO-8601 datetime of the manual review.
- [ ] `notes` (recommended) records what exactly was sourced from the page,
  so the next reviewer can re-verify quickly.

### When wrapping a value

Use the `verified()` helper. It will throw at module-load time if any of
the contract is violated.

```ts
contextWindow: verified(200_000, anthropicModelsOverview, {
  notes: "Listed as '200k tokens' on the Models overview page (legacy section).",
});
```

- [ ] The value matches the source verbatim or is a direct conversion
  (e.g. `200k` → `200_000`, no extrapolation).
- [ ] `confidence` is set to `"high"` only when the value is stated
  explicitly for *this exact model snapshot* on the source page. Down-grade
  to `"medium"` or `"low"` when the source covers a family broadly and the
  field is inferred. Record the reasoning in `notes`.
- [ ] If the source page says something subtly different (different
  precision, different unit, different snapshot), prefer `null` over a
  forced fit.

### Specifically forbidden moves

- ❌ Copying a value from another model's row because they're "in the same family."
- ❌ Averaging or rounding.
- ❌ Using a launch-day blog post as a source for current pricing.
- ❌ Inferring a release date from a blog post when only the snapshot date is in the docs.
- ❌ Asserting "vision support" because Anthropic generally supports it — confirm for the specific snapshot.
- ❌ Republishing vendor-reported benchmark scores without an independent reference.

### After editing

- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes.
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes.
- [ ] `npm run build` passes (this is where field-level `verified()`
  contracts get evaluated; malformed citations fail the build).
- [ ] Open the affected model / comparison page locally and confirm the
  citation links resolve and the `src` chip points at the correct URL.

## Lifecycle: deprecated and retired models

A deprecated model is still kept in the catalogue. It is **not deleted** —
historical entries are part of the intelligence graph. Mark it via:

```ts
lifecycle: verified(
  { status: "deprecated", retirementDate: "YYYY-MM-DD", migrationTarget: "<slug>" },
  citation,
  { notes: "..." }
)
```

The `<LifecycleBadge>` will surface "Deprecated · retires YYYY-MM-DD" and
JSON-LD will emit a `disambiguatingDescription` warning.

When a snapshot is fully retired, escalate `lifecycle.status` to `"retired"`
and add a clear migration breadcrumb to the description. Do not silently
remove the entity.

---

## Comparison pages

Comparison entities **never declare a winner**. The type
`ComparisonEntity` carries `declaresWinner: false` as a type-level
reminder. Every comparison page renders an explicit "No winner declared"
note above the table.

When writing the `useCases` list, describe workloads each model is *used
for* (neutral, observed). Avoid "best for", "outperforms",
"recommended for". Use cases are not endorsements.

---

## JSON-LD policy

`buildModelJsonLd` (in `apps/models/lib/model-jsonld.ts`) only emits
schema.org claims for verified fields. Search engines and LLMs treat
JSON-LD as factual. Adding a metric to the page is not enough — it must
also be guarded in the JSON-LD builder. The builder uses the same
`isVerified()` guard as the rest of the UI.

---

## Re-verification cadence

| Field | Re-check cadence |
| --- | --- |
| Pricing | Every 30 days, and immediately on any vendor pricing update. |
| Lifecycle (deprecation, retirement) | Every 30 days, plus on every Anthropic / OpenAI / Google deprecation notice. |
| Context window, max output, modality | Every 90 days; these change less frequently. |
| Benchmark scores | Only when a new primary-source benchmark publication lands. |
| Latency / uptime | Continuously, once an independent monitor is wired. Until then, leave null. |

The `lastCheckedAt` field on each entity records the last full sweep.
A field whose `retrievedAt` (on its citation) is older than its cadence
should be re-verified or downgraded to `null`.

## Status of the seed catalogue (2026-05-20)

Verified end-to-end against Anthropic's official Models overview
([source](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview))
and Pricing reference
([source](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing)):

- **Claude Opus 4.7** (`claude-opus-4-7`) — current Anthropic flagship.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) — current Sonnet tier.
- **Claude Haiku 4.5** (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) — current Haiku tier.
- **Claude Opus 4** (`claude-opus-4-20250514`) — gold-standard worked
  example. **Deprecated**, retires 2026-06-15. Retained for historical
  record and to anchor the verification workflow.

Unverified catalogue entries (`gpt-5`, `gemini-2-5-pro`, `deepseek-r1`,
`llama-4-scout`, `mistral-large-2`): structural entries only. Every
metric is `null` and renders the canonical unverified-data label until
a primary-source review completes per provider.

OpenAI's docs (platform.openai.com) currently block automated retrieval
(HTTP 403). Verifying GPT-5 against the OpenAI documentation page is
deferred until a manual review pass.
